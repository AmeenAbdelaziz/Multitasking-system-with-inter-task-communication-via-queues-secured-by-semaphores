# Multitasking-system-with-inter-task-communication-via-queues-secured-by-semaphores

This project was made using STK600 Board with ATmega2560 AVR Microcontroller. 
it is about creating a producer-consumer system consisting of seven tasks
(four generators, two consumers, one controller). In addition, 2
purely timer‚Äêcontrolled procedures, which cause LEDs to flash at different frequencies.
